A modular telegram Python UserBot running on python3 with a mongoDB, PostgreSQL coupled with Redis backend.

Started up as a simple bot, which helps with deleting messages and other stuffs when I didn't possess a smartphone(selecting each message indeed difficult) with a ton of meme features kanged from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot), it has evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.

For configuring this userbot, you can checkout the [Wiki](https://wiki.raphielgang.org)
